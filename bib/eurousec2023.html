<b>Lessons in Prevention and Cure: A User Study of Recovery from Flubot Smartphone Malware</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

The smishing-based malware Flubot was taken down in mid-2022, 
yet there is little understanding of how it directly impacted 
smartphone users. We engage with customers of a partner Internet 
Service Provider (ISP), who have suffered a Flubot infection on 
their smartphones. We surveyed 87 ISP customers who had been 
notified of a Flubot infection, in the months around and preceding 
the take-down of Flubot. We found that slightly over half of 
respondents were unaware of the malware infection before being 
notified, though many others had suspicions. We also observe that 
just over half of respondents experienced non-technical harms from 
the malware, with many experiencing harms before notification and 
several experiencing unwanted or aggressive activity from users of 
other infected devices. Many respondents reported not having 
removed the malware, while some discarded the infected device or 
stopped using online services in their efforts to be more secure 
afterwards. We offer recommendations, including that clearer 
guidance be sought to help users identify a malware infection 
(and not a focus only on prevention), and support provided for 
recovery from personal harms caused by mobile malware, as the 
impacts are not only technical.
