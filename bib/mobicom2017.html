<b>Poster: IoTURVA: Securing Device-to-Device Communications for IoT</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

In this poster we present IoTURVA, a platform for securing Device-to
-Device (D2D) communication in IoT. Our solution takes a blackbox
approach to secure IoT edge networks. We combine user and
device-centric context-information together with network data to
classify network communication as normal or malicious. We have
designed a dual-layer traffic classification scheme based on fuzzy
logic, where the classification model is trained remotely. The remotely
trained model is then used by the edge gateway to classify
the network traffic. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype
and evaluate its performance in a real world environment.
The evaluation shows that IoTurva causes very small overhead
while it works with minimal hardware, and that our model training
and classification approach can improve system efficiency and user
privacy.
