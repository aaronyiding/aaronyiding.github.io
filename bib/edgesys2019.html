<b>Edge Chaining Framework for Black Ice Road Fingerprinting</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Detecting and reacting efficiently to road condition hazards are 
challenging given practical restrictions such as limited data 
availability and lack of infrastructure support. In this paper, 
we present an edge-cloud chaining solution that bridges the cloud 
and road infrastructures to enhance road safety. We exploit the 
roadside infrastructure (e.g., smart lampposts) to form a processing 
chain at the edge nodes and transmit the essential context to 
approaching vehicles providing what we refer as road fingerprinting. 
We approach the problem from two angles: first we focus on 
semantically defining how an execution pipeline spanning edge and 
cloud is composed, then we design, implement and evaluate a working 
prototype based on our assumptions. In addition, we present 
experimental insights and outline open challenges for next steps.
