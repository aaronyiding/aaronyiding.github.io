<b>The Many Faces of Edge Intelligence</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Edge Intelligence (EI) is an emerging computing and communication 
paradigm that enables Artificial Intelligence (AI) functionality 
at the network edge. In this article, we highlight EI as an 
emerging and important field of research, discuss the state of 
research, analyze research gaps and highlight important research 
challenges with the objective of serving as a catalyst for 
research and innovation in this emerging area. We take a 
multidisciplinary view to reflect on the current research in AI, 
edge computing, and communication technologies, and we analyze 
how EI reflects on existing research in these fields. We also 
introduce representative examples of application areas that 
benefit from, or even demand the use of EI.
