<b>CoSense: A Collaborative Sensing Platform for Mobile Devices</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

We introduce CoSense, a collaborative sensing platform 
for mobile devices that opportunistically distributes 
sensing tasks between familiar devices in close proximity. 
We use empirical energy measurements together with data 
collected from everyday transportation behaviour to 
demonstrate that our solution can significantly reduce 
power consumption while maintaining the best possible 
sensing accuracy.
