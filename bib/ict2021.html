<b>Driving forces for Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) IoT integration in 5G</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

The emergence of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) technology aims 
to extend cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the wireless 
access networks, i.e., closer to the end-users. Thus, MEC-enabled 
5G wireless systems are envisaged to offer real-time, low-latency, 
and high-bandwidth access to the radio network resources. Thus, 
MEC allows network operators to open up their networks to a wide 
range of innovative services, thereby giving rise to a brand-new 
ecosystem and a value chain. Furthermore, MEC as an enabling 
technology will provide new insights into coherent integration of 
Internet of Things (IoT) in 5G wireless systems. In this context, 
this paper expounds the four key technologies, including Network 
Function Virtualization (NFV), Software Defined Networking (SDN), 
Network Slicing and Information Centric Networking (ICN), that 
will propel and intensify the integration of MEC IoT in 5G 
networks. Moreover, our goal is to provide the close alliance 
between MEC and these four driving technologies in the 5G IoT 
context and to identify the open challenges, future directions, 
and concrete integration paths.
