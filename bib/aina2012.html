<b>Harsh RED: Improving RED for Limited Aggregate Traffic</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

A bottleneck router typically resides close to the edge 
of the network where the aggregate traffic is often 
limited to a single or a few users only. With such limited 
aggregate traffic Random Early Detection (RED) on the 
bottleneck router is not able to properly respond to TCP 
slow start that causes rapid increase in load of the 
bottleneck. This results in falling back to tail-drop 
behavior or, at worst, triggers the RED maximum threshold 
cutter that drops all packets causing undesired break 
for all traffic that is passing through the bottleneck. 
We explain how TCP slow start, ACK clock and RED algorithm 
interact in such a situation, and propose Harsh RED (HRED) 
to properly address slow start in time. We perform a 
simulation study to compare HRED behavior to that of FIFO 
and RED with recommended parameters. We show that HRED 
avoids tail-drop and the maximum threshold cutter, has 
smaller queues, and provides less bursty drop distribution.
