<b>Security and Privacy in Device-to-Device (D2D) Communication: A Review</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Device-to-Device (D2D) communication presents a new paradigm in 
mobile networking to facilitate data exchange between physically 
proximate devices. The development of D2D is driven by mobile 
operators to harvest short range communications for improving 
network performance and supporting proximity-based services. In 
this article, we investigate two fundamental and interrelated 
aspects of D2D communication, security and privacy, which are 
essential for the adoption and deployment of D2D. We present an 
extensive review of the state-of-the-art solutions for enhancing 
security and privacy in D2D communication. By summarizing the 
challenges, requirements, and features of different proposals, 
we identify lessons to be learned from existing studies and 
derive a set of "best practices". The primary goal of our work is 
to equip researchers and developers with a better understanding of 
the underlying problems and the potential solutions for D2D security 
and privacy. To inspire follow-up research, we identify open 
problems and highlight future directions with regard to system 
and communication design. To the best of our knowledge, this is 
the first comprehensive review to address the fundamental security
and privacy issues in D2D communication.
