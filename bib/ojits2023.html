<b>Engaging the Crowd in Sensing for Smart Mobility: A Discrete Choice Experiment</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

With rising numbers of people living in cities leading to increasing 
congestion and pollution, mobile crowdsensing applications form a 
potential solution to make transport systems smarter and more efficient. 
However, sharing data comes with the risk of private information being 
disclosed. Therefore, a clear incentive is necessary to motivate smart 
device users to share data about their activities and their environment. 
Taking a choice modelling approach, this study aims to identify factors 
related to incentives and privacy that explain choice behavior of users 
in crowdsensing applications. We find that the effort required by users 
is a main factor influencing the willingness to share data. 47% of 
respondents ( n=125) indicated to be highly concerned about their privacy. 
However, the risk of re-identification was found to be the least important 
factor to respondents, a finding which could be explained by the Privacy 
Paradox. Our findings imply that a trade-off has to be made by developers 
of crowdsensing applications between the richness of information on one 
hand, and the privacy risks and participation rate of users on the other 
hand. We propose three practical principles for designing effective and 
value-sensitive crowdsensing applications for smart mobility, which are 
1) Tailor-made applications, 2) Transparency by design, and 3) Ensuring 
attractiveness of applications. Furthermore, our study provides a basis 
for further research on user preferences in smart mobility applications, 
which will become increasingly important in the light of current 
challenges in the field of mobility.
