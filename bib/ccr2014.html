<b>Bridging the Gap Between Internet Standardization and Networking Research</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

The participation of the network research community in the
Internet Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) has
been relatively low over the recent years, and this has drawn
attention from both academics and industry due to its possible
negative impact. The reasons for this gap are complex
and extend beyond the purely technical. In this editorial we
share our views on this challenge, based on the experience
we have obtained from joint projects with universities and
companies. We highlight the lessons learned, covering both
successful and under-performing cases, and suggest viable
approaches to bridge the gap between networking research
and Internet standardization, aiming to promote and maximize
the outcome of such collaborative endeavours.
