<b>Demo: Cloud-based Security as a Service for Smart IoT Environments</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

We demonstrate the first cloud-based solution for providing 
network security as a service in smart home IoT environments. 
Our solution uses Software-defined Networking (SDN) for 
controlling traffic flows inside the network and offloads 
traffic analysis tasks to a smart Cloud-based Traffic 
Analyzer (CbTA), which uses a crowd sourced knowledge base 
for detecting network threats and attacks. It is a scalable, 
cost-efficient, easily deployable as well as manageable 
solution for securing different network environments.
