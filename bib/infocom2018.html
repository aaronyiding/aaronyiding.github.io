<b>Flutes vs. Cellos: Analyzing Mobility-Traffic Correlations in Large WLAN Traces</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Two major factors affecting mobile network performance are 
mobility and traffic patterns. Simulations and analytical-based
performance evaluations rely on models to approximate factors 
affecting the network. Hence, the understanding of mobility 
and traffic is imperative to the effective evaluation and 
efficient design of future mobile networks. Current models 
target either mobility or traffic, but do not capture their 
interplay. Many trace-based mobility models have largely used 
pre-smartphone datasets (e.g., AP-logs), or much coarser 
granularity (e.g., cell-towers) traces. This raises questions
regarding the relevance of existing models, and motivates our 
study to revisit this area. In this study, we conduct a 
multi-dimensional analysis, to quantitatively characterize 
mobility and traffic spatio-temporal patterns, for laptops and 
smartphones, leading to a detailed integrated mobility-traffic 
analysis. Our study is data-driven, as we collect and mine 
capacious datasets (with 30TB, 300k devices) that capture all 
of these dimensions. The investigation is performed using our 
systematic (FLAMeS) framework. Overall, dozens of mobility and 
traffic features have been analyzed. The insights and lessons 
learnt serve as guidelines and a first step towards future 
integrated mobility-traffic models. In addition, our work acts 
as a stepping-stone towards a richer, more-realistic suite of 
mobile test scenarios and benchmarks.
