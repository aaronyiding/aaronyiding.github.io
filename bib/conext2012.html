<b>Enabling Energy-aware Mobile Data Offloading for Smartphones Through Vertical Collaboration</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Searching for mobile data offloading solutions 
has become topical in recent years. In the 
Metropolitan Advanced Delivery Network (MADNet) 
project, we explore the potential of multiple 
interfaces on smartphones through a collaborative 
design to enable energy-aware WiFi-based mobile 
data offloading. We advocate that the vertical 
collaboration across different wireless access 
technologies and network vendors is the key to 
aggregate the power of mobile operators, WiFi 
service providers, and end-users. Aiming at 
reducing the energy consumption on smartphones, 
we propose an energy-aware algorithm supported 
by our collaborative architecture to avoid 
offloading to low-throughput WiFi networks which 
may consume more energy. The evaluation of 
streaming applications on our prototyped Nokia 
N900 smartphones demonstrates that we are able 
to achieve more than 80% energy saving. Our 
experiment in the wild also shows that our design 
can tolerate the minor errors of localization, 
mobility prediction, and offload capacity estimation.
