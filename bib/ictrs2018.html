<b>Opportunities for Applications Using 5G Networks: Requirements, Challenges, and Outlook</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

The increasing demand for mobile network capacity driven by 
Internet of Things (IoT) applications results in the need 
for understanding better the potential and limitations of 
5G networks. Vertical application areas like smart mobility, 
energy networks, industrial IoT applications, and AR/VR 
enhanced services all pose different requirements on the 
use of 5G networks. Some applications need low latency, 
whereas others need high bandwidth or security support. 
The goal of this paper is to identify the requirements and 
to understand the limitations for 5G driven applications. 
We review application areas and list the typical challenges 
and requirements posed on 5G networks. A main challenge 
will be to develop a network architecture being able to 
dynamically adapt to fluctuating traffic patterns and 
accommodating various technologies such as edge computing, 
blockchain based distributed ledger, software defined 
networking, and virtualization. To inspire future research, 
we reveal open problems and highlight the need for piloting 
with 5G applications, with tangible steps, to understand 
the configuration of 5G networks and the use of 
applications across multiple vertical industries.
