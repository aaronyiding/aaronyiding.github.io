<b>Demo: An Open-source Software Defined Platform for Collaborative and Energy-aware WiFi Offloading</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

This demonstration presents a novel software defined platform 
for achieving collaborative and energy-aware WiFi offloading. 
The platform consists of an extensible central controller, 
programmable offloading agents, and offloading extensions on 
mobile devices. Driven by our extensive measurements of energy 
consumption on smartphones, we propose an effective energy-aware 
offloading algorithm and integrate it to our platform. By 
enabling collaboration between wireless networks and mobile 
users, our solution can make optimal offloading decisions that 
improve offloading efficiency for network operators and achieve 
energy saving for mobile users. To enhance deployability, we 
have released our platform under open-source licenses on GitHub.
