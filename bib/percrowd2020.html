<b>Multimodal Co-Presence Detection with Varying Spatio-Temporal Granularity</b> 

To appear in March 2020

<i>Abstract</i>:

Pervasive computing environments are characterized by a plethora 
of sensing and communication-enabled devices that diffuse 
themselves among different users. Built-in sensors and 
telecommunication infrastructure allow co-presence detection. In 
turn, co-presence detection enables context-aware 
applications, like those for social networking among close-by 
users, and for modeling human behavior. We aim to support 
developers building better context-aware applications by a 
deepened understanding of which set of context information is 
appropriate for co-presence detection. We have gathered a 
multimodal dataset for proximity sensing, including several 
proximity verification sets, like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and 
GSM encounters, to be able to associate sensor's data with a 
spatial granularity. We show that sensor modalities are suitable 
to recognize the spatial adjacency of users with different 
spatio-temporal granularity. We find that individual user 
mobility has only a minor, negligible effect on co-presence 
detection. In contrast, the heterogeneity of device's sensor 
hardware has a major negative impact on co-presence detection. 
To reveal energy pitfalls with respect to usability, we perform 
an energy analysis pertaining to the usage stemming from 
different sensors for co-presence detection.
