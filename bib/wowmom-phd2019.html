<b>The Road Towards Private Proximity Services</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Towards private proximity services, we realized a set of 
proximity services at different spatial resolutions. For 
small-scale (~ 0.5 m) securing remote access to smart 
homes and for mid-scale (10-20 m) to manage nearby 
Internet of Things (IoT) devices and offer fine-grained 
service discovery in indoor environments. Regarding 
large-scale services (100 m), we implemented a device 
grouping via similarity of light patterns, ambient sound, 
Wi-Fi signals, and ultrasound communication which is 
naturally restricted by spatial barriers. To improve 
user's privacy from a system point of view, we analyzed 
different security mechanisms in the domain of 
device-to-device (D2D) communication such as access 
control, location privacy. Based on visible light 
communication (VLC), we implemented and tested a system 
for private indoor service discovery and distance-bounding 
authorization. Furthermore, we examined the feasibility 
of homomorphic encryption for time-series data like 
visible light patterns.
