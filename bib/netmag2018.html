<b>Consolidate IoT Edge Computing with Lightweight Virtualization</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Lightweight Virtualization (LV) technologies have refashioned the world 
of software development by introducing flexibility and new ways of 
managing and distributing software. Edge computing complements today's 
powerful centralized data centers with a large number of distributed 
nodes that provide virtualization close to the data source and end users.
This emerging paradigm offers ubiquitous processing capabilities on a 
wide range of heterogeneous hardware characterized by different processing 
power and energy availability. The scope of this article is to present 
an in-depth analysis on the requirements of edge computing in the perspective 
of three selected use cases particularly interesting for harnessing the 
power of the Internet of Things (IoT). We discuss and compare the 
applicability of two LV technologies, containers and unikernels, as platforms 
for enabling scalability, security and manageability required by such 
pervasive applications that soon may be part of our every-day life. To 
inspire further research, we identify open problems and highlight
future directions to serve as a road map for both industry and academia.
