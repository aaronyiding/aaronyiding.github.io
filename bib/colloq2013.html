<b>Collaborative Communication and Sensing for Mobile Systems</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

The communication and sensing capabilities of mobile 
devices are improving dramatically in recent years 
together with the upgrading of wireless access 
infrastructure including the cellular and WiFi networks. 
However, the existing communication design is incapable 
of fully utilizing the resources offered by devices 
and networks, resulting in degraded service and user 
experience in terms of performance and battery life. 
My PhD research investigates this domain with a focus 
on developing solutions that can utilize the capability 
of networking interfaces and sensors collaboratively 
across devices and networks to achieve better 
performance and energy efficiency.
