<b>UIDS: Unikernel-based Intrusion Detection System for the Internet of Things</b>

To appear in February

<i>Abstract</i>:

The advent of the Internet of Things promises to interconnect 
all type of devices, including the most common electrical 
appliances such as ovens and light bulbs. One of the greatest 
risks of the uncontrolled proliferation of resource constrained 
devices are the security and privacy implications. Most 
manufacturers' top priority is getting their product into the 
market quickly, rather than taking the necessary steps to build 
security from the start, due to high competitiveness of the 
field. Moreover, standard security tools are tailored to 
server-class machines and not directly applicable in the IoT 
domain. To address these problems, we propose a lightweight, 
signature-based intrusion detection system for IoT to be able 
to run on resource-constrained devices. Our prototype is based 
on the IncludeOS unikernel, ensuring low resource utilization, 
high modularity, and a minimalist code surface. In particular, 
we evaluate the performance of our solution on x86 and ARM 
devices and compare it against Snort, a widely known network 
intrusion detection system. The experimental results show that 
our prototype effectively detects all attack patterns while 
using up to 2-3x less CPU and 8x less RAM than our baseline.
