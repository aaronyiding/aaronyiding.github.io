<b>DevLoc: Seamless Device Association using Light Bulb Networks for Indoor IoT Environments</b>

To appear in April 2020

<i>Abstract</i>:

For indoor IoT environments, spontaneous device 
associations are of particular interest where users 
establish a connection in an ad-hoc manner to enable 
serendipitous interaction. For instance, between a 
user's personal device and devices the user encounters 
in the surrounding environment. Our system for device 
grouping named DevLoc takes advantage of ubiquitous 
light sources around us to perform continuous device 
grouping based on the similarity of light signals. To 
control the spatial granularity of user's proximity, 
we provide a configuration framework to manage the 
lighting infrastructure through customized visible 
communication. We support two modes of device 
associations to achieve a binding between different 
entities: device-to-device and device-to-area allowing 
either proximity-based or location-based services. Our 
device grouping includes several methods where in 
general the machine learning based signal similarity 
performs best compared to distance and correlation 
metrics. To improve data privacy, we analyze patterns 
of device associations to recognize semantic device 
groups such as personal and stranger's devices.
