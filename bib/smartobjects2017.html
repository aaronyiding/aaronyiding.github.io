<b>Managing IoT at the Edge: The Case for BLE Beacons</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Managing IoT devices in urban areas is becoming crucial because 
the majority of people living in cities and the number of 
deployed IoT devices are steadily increasing. In this paper we 
present iConfig, an edge-driven platform dedicated to manage IoT 
devices in smart cities. The goal is to address three major 
issues in current IoT management: registration, configuration, 
and maintenance. The core of iConfig is its programmable edge 
module, which can be deployed across smartphones, wearables, and 
smart boards to configure and interact with physically proximate 
IoT devices. Through testbed experiments and usability studies, 
we reveal the hardship and hidden pitfalls in managing IoT 
devices, especially for low budget Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 
beacons. Our system evaluation shows that iConfig can 
effectively address the aforementioned IoT management challenges 
by harnessing the mobile and edge cooperation. To inspire 
community contributions, we further present concrete use cases 
to illustrate how iConfig can reduce operational cost and 
facilitate future edge-centric IoT research.
