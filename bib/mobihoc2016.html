<b>P2Hub Private Personal Data Hub for Mobile Devices: Poster</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Mobile and wearable devices like smartphones or tablets are data hubs 
of our digital life and contain a high amount of sensitive data, which 
makes them a potential target for attackers. The aim of our P2Hub 
approach is to consider the privacy-by-architecture principle directly 
during the system design phase. We enhance the isolation of sensitive 
private information through a privacy-preserving module supported by 
novel, lightweight virtualization techniques. Thus, we inherently 
improve the system's security and privacy.
