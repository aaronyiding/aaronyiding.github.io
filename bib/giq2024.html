<b>Transforming towards inclusion-by-design: Information system design principles shaping data-driven financial inclusiveness</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Digitalization and datafication of financial systems result in 
more efficiency, but might also result in the exclusions of 
certain groups. Governments are looking for ways to increase 
inclusions and leave no one behind. For this, they must govern 
an organizational ecosystem of public and private parties. 
We derive value-based requirements through a systematic research 
methodology and iteratively refine design principles for 
achieving inclusivity goals. This refinement process is enriched 
by interviews with field experts, leading to the formulation of 
key Design principles: the essential role of inclusive metrics, 
leveraging alternative data sources, ensuring transparency in 
loan processes and the ability for decision contestation, 
providing tailored credit solutions, and maintaining long-term 
system sustainability. The government's role is to ensure a 
level playing field where all parties have equal access to the 
data. Following the principles ensures that exclusion and 
discrimination become visible and can be avoided. This study 
underscores the necessity for system-level transformations, 
inclusion-by-design, and advocacy for a new system design 
complemented by regulatory updates, new data integration, 
inclusive AI, and organizational collaborative shifts. These 
principles can also be used in different data-driven governance 
situations.
