<b>Poster: SoftOffload: A Programmable Approach Toward Collaborative Mobile Traffic Offloading</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

The fast increase of mobile traffic from smartphone-like 
devices has created a huge pressure for the cellular 
operators to manage the network infrastructure and resources. 
Offloading the mobile traffic to alternative networks such 
as WiFi is sought as a promising direction to solve this 
problem cost-effectively. According to our study and 
experimental findings, existing research proposals are 
lack of concern for the complexity of network deployment 
and device limitations, which impedes the solution deployment. 
To overcome such challenge, we propose SoftOffload, a 
programmable framework for collaborative mobile traffic 
offloading. SoftOffload takes the advantage of software 
defined networking (SDN) paradigm in terms of openness and 
extensibility. We have implemented the first prototype 
utilising the open source Floodlight platform.
