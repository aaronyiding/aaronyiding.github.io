<b>Towards Trustworthy Edge Intelligence: Insights from Voice-activated Services</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

In an age of surveillance capitalism, anchoring the design of emerging 
smart services in trustworthiness is urgent and important. 
Edge Intelligence, which brings together the fields of AI and Edge 
computing, is a key enabling technology for smart services. Trustworthy 
Edge Intelligence should thus be a priority research concern. However, 
determining what makes Edge Intelligence trustworthy is not straight 
forward. This paper examines requirements for trustworthy Edge 
Intelligence in a concrete application scenario of voice-activated 
services. We contribute to deepening the understanding of 
trustworthiness in the emerging Edge Intelligence domain in three ways: 
firstly, we propose a unified framing for trustworthy Edge Intelligence 
that jointly considers trustworthiness attributes of AI and the IoT. 
Secondly, we present research outputs of a tangible case study in 
voice-activated services that demonstrates interdependencies between 
three important trustworthiness attributes: privacy, security and 
fairness. Thirdly, based on the empirical and analytical findings, 
we highlight challenges and open questions that present important 
future research areas for trustworthy Edge Intelligence.
