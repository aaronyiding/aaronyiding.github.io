<b>Adaptive Approximate Computing in Edge AI and IoT Applications: A Review</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Recent advancements in hardware and software systems have been driven by 
the deployment of emerging smart health and mobility applications. 
These developments have modernized the traditional approaches by replacing 
conventional computing systems with cyberâ€“physical and intelligent systems 
combining the Internet of Things (IoT) with Edge Artificial Intelligence. 
Despite the many advantages and opportunities of these systems within 
various application domains, the scarcity of energy, extensive computing 
needs, and limited communication must be considered when orchestrating 
their deployment. Inducing savings in these directions is central to the 
Approximate Computing (AxC) paradigm, in which the accuracy of some 
operations is traded off with energy, latency, and/or communication 
reductions. Unfortunately, the dynamics of the environments in which 
AxC-equipped IoT systems operate have been paid little attention. We 
bridge this gap by surveying adaptive AxC techniques applied to three 
emerging application domains, namely autonomous driving, smart sensing 
and wearables, and positioning, paying special attention to hardware 
acceleration. We discuss the challenges of such applications, how adaptive 
AxC can aid their deployment, and which savings it can bring based on 
traits of the data and devices involved. Insights arising thereof may 
serve as inspiration to researchers, engineers, and students active 
within the considered domains.
