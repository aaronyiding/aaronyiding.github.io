<b>Enhancing the Internet of Things with Knowledge-Driven 
Software-Defined Networking Technology: Future Perspectives</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

The Internet of Things (IoT) connects smart devices to enable
various intelligent services. The deployment of IoT encounters 
several challenges, such as difficulties in controlling and 
managing IoT applications and networks, problems in programming 
existing IoT devices, long service provisioning time, underused 
resources, as well as complexity, isolation and scalability, 
among others. One fundamental concern is that current IoT 
networks lack flexibility and intelligence. A network-wide 
flexible control and management are missing in IoT networks. 
In addition, huge numbers of devices and large amounts of data 
are involved in IoT, but none of them have been tuned for 
supporting network management and control. In this paper, we 
argue that Software-defined Networking (SDN) together with the 
data generated by IoT applications can enhance the control and 
management of IoT in terms of flexibility and intelligence. 
We present a review for the evolution of SDN and IoT and 
analyze the benefits and challenges brought by the integration 
of SDN and IoT with the help of IoT data. We discuss the 
perspectives of knowledge-driven SDN for IoT through a new IoT 
architecture and illustrate how to realize Industry IoT by 
using the architecture. We also highlight the challenges and 
future research works toward realizing IoT with the 
knowledge-driven SDN.
