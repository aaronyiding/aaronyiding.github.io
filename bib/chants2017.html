<b>IOTURVA: Securing Device-to-Device (D2D) Communication in IoT Networks</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

We present IOTURVA, a platform dedicated to securing
Device-to-Device (D2D) communication in IoT networks.
IOTURVA targets an alarming and yet unexplored region in
IoT security, where the interactions and dependencies across
heterogeneous IoT devices are extremely hard to secure and
regulate. Different from existing proposals that mostly tackle
conventional device-to-infrastructure communication for IoT, our
solution embeds the security functions within the connectivity
for IoT devices and can provide selective network isolation
at device-level granularity. To demonstrate IOTURVA, we have
implemented a prototype and evaluated it through several live
scenarios in the testbed. Our results show that IOTURVA is
responsive and can effectively control cross-device dependencies
and D2D interactions in IoT networks.
