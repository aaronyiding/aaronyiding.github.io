<b>The Virtual Factory: Hologram-Enabled Control and Monitoring of Industrial IoT Devices</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Augmented reality has been exploited in manifold fields but is 
yet to be used at its full potential. With the massive
diffusion of smart devices, opportunities to build immersive 
human-computer interfaces are continually expanding. In this 
study, we conceptualize a virtual factory: an interactive, 
dynamic, holographic abstraction of the physical machines 
deployed in a factory. Through our prototype implementation, 
we conducted a user-study driven evaluation of holographic 
interfaces compared to traditional interfaces, highlighting 
its pros and cons. Our study shows that the majority of the 
participants found holographic manipulation more attractive 
and natural to interact with. However, current performance 
characteristics of head-mounted displays must be improved to 
be applied in production.
