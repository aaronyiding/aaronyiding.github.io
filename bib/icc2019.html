<b>Enhancing Indoor IoT Communication with Visible Light and Ultrasound</b> 

Acceptance rate 39% out of 2590 submissions

<i>Abstract</i>:

The number of deployed Internet of Things (IoT) devices is 
steadily increasing to directly manage and interact with 
community assets of smart cities, such as transportation
systems and power plants. This leads to a degraded network
performance due to the growing amount of network traffic and
connections generated by various IoT devices. To tackle these
issues, one promising direction is to leverage the physical 
proximity of communicating devices and inter-device communication
to achieve low latency, bandwidth efficiency, and resilient 
services. In this work, we aim at enhancing the performance of 
indoor IoT communication (e.g., smart homes, SOHO) by taking 
advantage of emerging technologies such as visible light and 
ultrasound. This approach increases the network capacity, 
robustness of network connections across IoT devices, and 
provides efficient means to enable distance-bounding services. 
We have developed communication modules using off-the-shelf 
components for visible light and ultrasound, and evaluate their 
network performance and energy consumption. In addition, we 
showcase the efficacy of our communication modules by applying 
them in a practical indoor IoT scenario to realize secure IoT 
group communication.
