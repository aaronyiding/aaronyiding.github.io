<b>Touchless Wireless Authentication via LocalVLC</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

In this demo, we present LocalVLC, a ready-to-deploy 
platform that takes advantage of VLC to realize 
distance-bounding services. Our goal is to build a user friendly 
VLC-based system that can harness the unique property of visible 
light to respect spatial barriers like doors and walls. LocalVLC 
transmits data by switching the current of the LEDs on and off 
at high frequency so that the switching effect is too quick to 
be noticed by human eyes. Our design suits for dense wireless 
IoT deployment as visible light does not interfere with other 
existing wireless infrastructure (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy). 
LocalVLC introduces a lightweight Morse data encoding adjusted 
for VLC to deliver fine-grained and low-cost distance boundary 
control. We have implemented a full-fledged platform prototype 
to demonstrate the practicality of LocalVLC.
