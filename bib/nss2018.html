<b>Real-time IoT Device Activity Detection in Edge Networks</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

The growing popularity of Internet-of-Things (IoT) has created 
the need for network-based traffic anomaly detection systems 
that could identify misbehaving devices. In this work, we 
propose a lightweight technique, IoTguard, for identifying 
malicious traffic flows. IoTguard uses semi-supervised learning 
to distinguish between malicious and benign device behaviours 
using the network traffic generated by devices. In order to 
achieve this, we extracted 39 features from network logs and 
discard any features containing redundant information. After 
feature selection, fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) algorithm was trained 
to obtain clusters discriminating benign traffic from malicious 
traffic. We studied the feature scores in these clusters and 
use this information to predict the type of new traffic flows. 
IoTguard was evaluated using a real-world testbed with more 
than 30 devices. The results show that IoTguard achieves high 
accuracy (>98%), in differentiating various types of malicious 
and benign traffic, with low false positive rates. Furthermore, 
it has low resource footprint and can operate on OpenWRT 
enabled access points and COTS computing boards.
