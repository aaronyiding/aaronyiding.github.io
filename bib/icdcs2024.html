<b>Dissecting the Applicability of HTTP/3 in Content Delivery Networks</b> 

<i>Abstract</i>:

HTTP/3 (H3) has experienced significant growth and extensive adoption in 
various scenarios, especially in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). Over 
the past few years, there have been numerous insightful studies on its 
deployment in the industrial CDN. However, these studies often separately 
analyze H3 and CDN, overlooking their synergistic integration. In this 
work, we explore the applicability of H3 in CDN from a holistic perspective. 
We analyze 325 websites hosted by seven CDN providers and identify three 
key characteristics where CDN align perfectly with H3's strengths. Firstly, 
CDN resources dominate the composition of webpages, where enabling H3 can 
amplify H3's benefits in connection acceleration. Secondly, CDN providers 
also exhibit a dominant characteristic, with the majority of CDN resources 
hosted by a few large providers. This phenomenon makes different webpages 
share the same provider. When browsing consecutively, H3 helps to skip the 
connection phase by resuming the connections to the same CDN provider 
across pages. Thirdly, H3 mitigates the congestion problem on webpages 
serving multiple CDN resources. This work provides a deeper insight into 
the applicability of H3 in large-scale distributed systems like CDNs, 
holding promise for informing the development and optimization of industrial H3.
