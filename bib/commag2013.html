<b>Toward Network Controlled IP Traffic Offloading</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Operator controlled IP traffic offloading in cellular networks 
has been a lively topic in both product and standard development 
during recent years. Specifically, 3GPP has developed multiple 
IP traffic offloading solutions for their system architecture, 
typically requiring 3GPP-specific modifications for user equipment. 
We argue that an adequate lightweight access technology agnostic 
IP traffic offloading system is achievable with a generic internet 
layer solution. Such a solution can still utilize 3GPP system 
properties for operators to push offloading policies securely into 
mobile devices. We discuss existing 3GPP-specified offloading 
solutions and present three variations of our internet layer 
traffic offloading implementations, and compare them against 
3GPP-specified solutions. Our hands-on experience in operator 
networks shows that such a direction is feasible and promising.
