<b>Effect of Competing TCP Traffic on Interactive Real-time Communication</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Providing acceptable quality level for interactive media 
flows such as interactive video or audio is challenging 
in the presence of TCP traffic. Volatile TCP traffic such 
as Web traffic causes transient queues to appear and 
vanish rapidly introducing jitter to the packets of the 
media flow. Meanwhile long-lived TCP connections cause 
standing queues to form which increases the one-way delay 
for the media flow packets. To get insights into this 
problem space we conducted experiments in a real high-speed 
cellular network. Our results confirm the existence of 
issues with both Web-like traffic and long-lived TCP 
connections and highlight that current trend of using 
several parallel connections in Web browsers tends to 
have high cost on media flows. In addition, the recent 
proposal to increase the initial window of TCP to ten 
segments, if deployed, is going to make the jitter 
problem even worse.
