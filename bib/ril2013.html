<b>Supporting Low Latency near the Network Edge and with Challenging Link Technologies</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

In this paper we focus on discussing the challenges of providing
low-latency IP service when bursty (Web style) traffic
is present on bottleneck access links and, in particular, when
the Internet access is with challenging link technologies such
as cellular and many other wireless WAN access networks.
