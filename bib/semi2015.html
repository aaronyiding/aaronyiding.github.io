<b>Reflections on Middlebox Detection Mechanisms in IPv6 Transition</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

Middleboxes performing Network Address Translation (NAT)
have gained a positive role in the IPv6 transition by 
enabling interoperability of different IP versions, i.e., 
IPv4 and IPv6. Although the NAT-based mechanisms pave 
the way for a smooth adoption of IPv6 in the transition,
we shall be prudent towards such middlebox-oriented 
approach due to its complexity and overhead for end 
users and network services. In this position paper, we 
discuss the middlebox detection mechanisms designed
for IPv6 transition, focusing on NAT64 in specific, 
and share our hands-on experience in protocol design 
and standardization. Based on our experimental findings, 
we identify issues in the existing approaches and offer 
suggestions to protocol designers and researchers. The 
goal is to improve our understanding of the middleboxes 
and hence leading to a more robust design of protocols 
for the evolving IPv6 Internet.
