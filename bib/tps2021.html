<b>Trustworthy and Sustainable Edge AI: A Research Agenda</b> 

<i>Abstract</i>:

As a fast evolving domain that merges edge computing, data analytics 
and AI/ML, commonly referred as Edge AI, the community of Edge AI is 
establishing and gradually finds its way to connect with mainstream 
research communities of distributed systems, IoT, and embedded 
machine learning. Meanwhile, despite of its well-claimed potential 
to transform cloud and IoT industry, Edge AI is still a complex 
subject that faces critical challenges from the trustworthy and 
sustainable concerns. To shed light on these pressing matters, this 
paper aims to develop a research agenda for trustworthy and 
sustainable Edge AI. We clarify the concepts, define the proper 
scoping and propose a research agenda for Edge AI to be trustworthy 
and sustainable. To illustrate the research agenda in practice, we 
highlight two active R&D projects: the SPATIAL project on 
trustworthy Edge AI and the APROPOS project on sustainable computing. 
The projects serve as concrete use cases to explore the agenda 
development. Our goal is to equip researchers, engineers, service 
providers, government and public sectors with a better understanding 
of the underlying concepts and to raise awareness of emerging 
directions in trustworthy and sustainable Edge AI.
