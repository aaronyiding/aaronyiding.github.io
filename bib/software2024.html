<b>Understanding Work Rhythms in Software Development and Their Effects on Technical Performance</b>

<i>Abstract</i>:

The temporal patterns of code submissions, denoted as work rhythms, 
provide valuable insight into the work habits and productivity in 
software development. In this paper, we investigate the work rhythms 
in software development and their effects on technical performance 
by analyzing the profiles of developers and projects from 110 
international organizations and their commit activities on GitHub. 
Using clustering, we identify four work rhythms among individual 
developers and three work rhythms among software projects. Strong 
correlations are found between work rhythms and work regions, 
seniority, and collaboration roles. We then define practical 
measures for technical performance and examine the effects of 
different work rhythms on them. Our findings suggest that moderate 
overtime is related to good technical performance, whereas fixed 
office hours are associated with receiving less attention. 
Furthermore, we survey 92 developers to understand their experience 
with working overtime and the reasons behind it. The survey reveals 
that developers often work longer than required. A positive attitude 
towards extended working hours is associated with situations that 
require addressing unexpected issues or when clear incentives are 
provided. Besides the insights from our quantitative and qualitative 
studies, this work sheds light on tangible measures for both software 
companies and individual developers to improve the recruitment 
process, project planning, and productivity assessment.
